# Water Quality Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict the quality of water using real-world datasets with key physicochemical and biological indicators. It combines data preprocessing, threshold-based classification, and machine learning modeling for intelligent, proactive water quality management.

---

## üìä Dataset
The dataset includes parameters such as:

- Ammonia Nitrogen (mg/L)
- Dissolved Oxygen (% saturation & mg/L)
- Faecal Coliforms (cfu/100mL)
- Nitrate, Nitrite, Total Nitrogen
- Orthophosphate Phosphorus, Total Phosphorus
- Temperature, pH, Suspended Solids
- Chlorophyll-a, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen

With thresholds applied to assess water quality.

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions and correlations
   - Identify potential outliers and anomalies

3. **Threshold Classification**
   - Label samples as 'Good' or 'Poor' based on provided water quality thresholds

4. **Model Building**
   - Train ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

5. **Deployment Options**
   - Run locally using Python
   - Execute in Google Colab (if GPU/remote access required)
